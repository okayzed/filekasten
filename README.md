## jot wiki

this is a file viewer for reading through markdown files. it initially started
as an idea to implement a wiki, but i didn't like having two copies of files, so
instead of a wiki, it is a file indexer and viewer.


#### moving pieces

* file ingestor and indexer
* file cleaner (remove old / deleted files)
* export and backup files
* web viewer and searcher
